## Description

Manually doing CI/CD on VPS servers are quite painful and unrealisticly slow. I want to change that. This is a custom Github Action Handler that would be called through a simple web request with the use of an additional cms system like [Cockpit (getcockpit.com)](https://getcockpit.com/)

## Usage
